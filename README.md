# LLM-putation


### Introduction

In this study, we delegated ChatGPT the task of imputing genes in meta-analysis studies,
previously published at the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB). We assessed the
performance of a ChatGPT-designed computational experiment and code generation against
those of human-created counterparts.

Furthermore, we evaluated the reproducibility of ChatGPTâ€™s experimental design, a crucial factor in scientific research. Our aim is to provide an insightful exploration into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT, offering a comprehensive understanding of its role in biological data analysis and computational research.

### Code

The Imputation.ipynb notebook contains the preprocessing steps of the incomplete data and all the Python code generated by ChatGPT.
